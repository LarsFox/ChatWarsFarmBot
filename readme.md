A spamming-farming bot for multiple accounts in a Telegram RPG

Everything is in Russian, since the game is available in Russian only.

First launch with `python3 main.py session1 -l` then with `session2`, until all of your accounts receive code and connect.
After that start with `python3 main.py separating sessions with spaces -s` to have them silenced. Check out `Makefile.sample` for more.

Works with the latest release of [telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon).

If you want to join the Farm Club, read `sessions.sample.py`.

Beware!
